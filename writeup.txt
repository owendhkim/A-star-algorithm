# Project 1 - Solving 8-puzzle with a-star algorithm

My h3 heuristic is counting the manhattan distance between the goal state,
with double moves allowed. I count the manhattan distance and check if
row or col value of it is 2, if so, I decrement it by one because double
moves are allowed in this case.

Since the problem was relaxed by allowing the double moves, it can never
require more steps than the original problem, therefore it is admissible.
And because it is admissible, it will produce an optimal solution.
